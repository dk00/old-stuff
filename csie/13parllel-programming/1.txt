Please describe the relation between T, the number of wave-fronts, and the following quantities in a dependency graph.

The number of tasks, N.
The number of processors, P.
The length of the longest path L.
The parallelism p, i.e., the maximum number of tasks in a wave-front.


T <= L <= N

T >= ceil(N/p) >= ceil(N/P)

p <= N

p <= P
