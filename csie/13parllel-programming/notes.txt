1. Write a sequential program that computes the square root from 
0 to 999999999 and assign the value to a variable v. 
Observe its timing. 
We can use  omp_get_wtime() to get the wal clock time. 
The return value is double. (L)

16.936 s

2. Now write two parallel versions of the previous program -- 
one declare v as global and one declare v as private, 
then observe the timing.

global: 11.720 s
private: 2.013 s
