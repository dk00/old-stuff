(1)First we should pre-calculate the primes between 10000 and 99999.
And consider (2)the left side and the upper side, they're the first
digits of every row / column, so they shouldn't be 0.
And the first digit is given, so we can (3)determinate upper side,
left side and one diagonal, and then do DFS on other digits.
And the other diagonal, (4)it has 3 digits that is determinated,
so we can just try the remaining two.
consider the last digits, if a number is prime, its (5)last digit
shouldn't be even numbers, zero or five.

Primes should be pre-calculated:
    1.every digit is not zero(upper / left side),and first digit is the
    given digit.
    2.every digit is not zero, even num or five(lower / right side)

1.abcde, afkpu, agmsy.
2.uqmie.
3.fghij, bglqv.

method:
    1.a is determinated,so we determinate abcde, afkpu and agmsy first.
    the primes that is used here should be pre-calculated. choose 3
    prime and check ume, bg, fg, cm, km, ds, ps, ey and uy, if all they
    are not bigger than the given sum, do next.
    
    2.Find uqmie. i and q should sum to something, change one and other
    will be changed, too. So we just use a loop to test all.
    We also check if it's bigger than the sum,if not do next.
    
    3.Find ejoty and uvwxy. the prime should be pre-calcued, too.
    and just fit it, do the same check as above.
    
    4.Finally there are four digits remained, it's easy to calculate,
    just fill it and do the check.
